# LaplaceDemonSims

This repository contains scripts and some input files for simulations of evolution. These were done to examine how different sources of randoness and uncertainty limit our ability to predict evolution. The results are described in a (draft) manuscript entitled "Laplaceâ€™s demon in biology: simulation models of evolutionary prediction".
